| ------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔰 **MVP Success**     | \$0–\$10K MRR    | If devs love the tool, share it, and you're able to build a community around your CLI + insights               |
| 🧭 Niche Leader    | \$10K–\$100K MRR | Focused success in AI-driven security/IaC in AWS/GCP; DevSecOps buy-in via integrations                        |
| 🚀 Breakout Growth | \$100K–\$1M+ MRR | Full SaaS suite, compliance readiness, org/team features, enterprise cloud integrations                        |
| 🦄 Unicorn/Exit    | Acquisition      | Acquired by larger CNAPP vendor, cloud provider, or platform engineering firm; you’re a niche they want to own |

## 📫 How We Can Outcompete
Speed and AI-native UX: The incumbents are heavy. You can be fast, smart, and precise — think Linear vs Jira.

Transparent and Open: Offer transparency, local scanning, or partial open-source (à la Terraform Cloud).

Community-First Distribution: Don’t go top-down sales. Go dev-first. Network with devs in discord, even your workplace, get feedback, refine, etc

Opinionated AI: Don’t just “suggest.” Build confidence by citing standards (e.g., CIS benchmarks), docs, or cost reports.

Build Relationships, not just software: Engage platform engineers and DevOps on Discord, GitHub, Twitter/X.

## 📫 Enterprise Baseline Requirements

These are the non-negotiables for enterprise adoption, especially in cloud infrastructure, security, and DevOps tooling:

1. Security & Compliance
✅ SOC2 Type II / ISO27001 readiness

✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

✅ SSO/SAML integration (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)

✅ Audit logs (immutable, exportable)

✅ Data encryption at rest and in transit

✅ No persistent storage of cloud credentials (or secure vault integration)

✅ Fine-grained permission scopes (least privilege)

✅ Support for private cloud/VPC deployment

2. Scalability & Reliability
✅ Multi-tenant SaaS or dedicated infrastructure

✅ Horizontally scalable microservices (esp. for scanning)

✅ Background jobs & queueing (for scanning large orgs)

✅ 99.9% uptime SLA or better

✅ Alerting, monitoring, and auto-healing mechanisms

3. Interoperability
✅ Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi integration

✅ GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket CI/CD hooks

✅ API access for custom automation

✅ Webhooks for events (e.g., “new misconfig found”)

✅ CLI, SDKs (Go, Python, JS), Terraform provider

✅ Integration with SIEMs (Splunk, Datadog, etc.)

4. Usability
✅ Web-based dashboard (real-time insights, filtering)

✅ Custom policy engine (like OPA/Rego or JSON/YAML DSL)

✅ Scheduled scans and continuous monitoring

✅ Multi-cloud visibility: dashboards showing AWS/GCP/Azure side-by-side

✅ Report exports (PDF, CSV, JSON)

✅ Email/Slack/MS Teams alerts

## 📫 Advanced Features (Ideas)
