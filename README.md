# 🔍 AI-Powered Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Analyzer

A high-performance, **Rust-based CLI tool** that intelligently scans cloud environments and leverages **Artificial Intelligence** to deliver actionable insights on **security**, **cost optimization**, **performance**, and **resilience**.

---

## ✨ Features (Current MVP)

Currently supports **AWS** infrastructure scanning and provides **AI-driven analysis**:

* ✅ Scans **S3 buckets** for insecure configurations like public access, unencrypted data, or lack of versioning.
* ✅ Audits **IAM roles and policies** to identify overly permissive access or adherence to least privilege.
* ✅ Inspects **Lambda functions** for potential security misconfigurations, such as broad execution privileges or missing timeout settings.
* ✅ Provides **AI-powered explanations and remediation suggestions** for identified findings, leveraging large language models to offer contextual insights and actionable steps.
* ✅ Supports **JSON output** for easy integration into CI/CD pipelines or further analysis.
* ✅ Securely loads **AWS credentials** from environment variables or `~/.aws` configuration, adhering to AWS best practices.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

Future versions aim for comprehensive multi-cloud coverage and advanced AI capabilities:

* 🌐 **Expanded Multi-Cloud Support**: Integrate scanning capabilities for **GCP**, **Azure**, **DigitalOcean**, **Hetzner**, **Akamai Cloud**, and **IBM Cloud**.
* 🤖 **Advanced AI-Driven Insights**:
    * Generate intelligent recommendations for **disaster recovery planning** and **business continuity**.
    * Propose concrete steps for **performance tuning** and **resource optimization** using cloud telemetry and metrics.
    * Identify and suggest fixes for complex **cost optimization** opportunities.
    * Leverage **Machine Learning**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **LLM fine-tuning** for deeper, more contextual analysis of findings.
* 📄 **Static Analysis**: Implement scanning for **Infrastructure-as-Code** (Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK) and **CI/CD pipeline configurations** to detect risks pre-deployment.
* 💡 **Enhanced Reporting**:
    * **Security Score**: Develop a quantifiable security score to track cloud posture improvements over time.
    * **Drift Detection (`scan --diff`)**: Identify and highlight configuration changes since the last scan.
    * **Automated Remediation (`scan --fix`)**: Provide options for CLI-level automatic fixes for selected issues (with explicit user consent).
    * **Custom Rule Plugins**: Enable users to define and extend scanning rules via simple scripts or configuration files.
* 📊 **Web-based Dashboard (Future Vision)**:
    * A centralized platform to visualize **historical scan logs**, track **security trends**, and manage **misconfiguration findings**.
    * Group findings by resource type, categorize by severity, and provide AI-generated explanations and recommendations.
    * Offer environment-specific views (e.g., `prod`, `staging`) and quick onboarding with secure authentication methods.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* 🦀 **Rust**: High-performance, memory-safe systems programming for reliable and efficient execution.
* ☁️ **AWS SDK for Rust**: Official SDK for seamless and secure interaction with AWS services.
* 🤖 **LLM Integration (OpenAI / Gemini)**: Utilizes large language models for intelligent analysis and actionable recommendations. Designed to be **provider-agnostic** for future flexibility.
* ⚡ **Tokio**: Asynchronous runtime enabling concurrent operations for fast scanning.
* ⚙️ **Configuration Management**: Employs the `config` crate for flexible loading of settings from `config.yaml` files and environment variables, ensuring secure credential handling.
* 🔐 **Security-First Design**: Built with a focus on not sending sensitive data to external servers by default and providing clear audit logging.
